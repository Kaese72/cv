					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Engineer by heart, administrator for a living. I love seeing things evolve over time which is why I started
						out in a development role and eventually ended up in quality assurance where my influence can be seen in how
						things are done in projects I work with. I am a firm believer in the power of automation and strive to get
						as much done as possible while having to do as little as possible.

					<h2>Quality Assurance Manager at Outpost24</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2021 - Present</p>
					<p>Steering the development organization from a quality perspective, ensuring that the right amount of effort
						goes into quality assurance wheighted by cost. Primary focus on test automation and efficiency
						gain over time. Role is primarily administrative but my history as a developer has lead to first hand involvement in the technical aspects too.
						Largest achievements so far include introdocing a system test framework, complete rehaul of the software design processess, and visulisation

					<h2>Developer at Outpost24</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2020 - 2021</p>
					<p>An "ordinary" development job focusing on backend of a managed penetration testing platform where I eventually became the lead developer
						before my transition to quality assurance. This role allowed me to get a deeper understanding of distributed systems using
						HTTP based REST APIs, a small bit of event based architecture, and GoLang which has become my primary language for stable software.

					<h2>Vulnerability Researcher at Outpost24</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2018 - 2020</p>
					<p>Straight out of university into the fire working as a vulnerability researcher in the infrastructure risk assesment unit.
						My work mainly consisted of automating detection of vulnerabilities for a risk assessment platform, writing in a C-like language,
						and eventually leading the modernization effort of the detection engine to a more modern platform that lives on to this day.
